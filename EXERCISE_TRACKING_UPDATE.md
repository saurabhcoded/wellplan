# Exercise-Based Tracking Update

## Overview
Updated the Daily Tracker to support individual exercise completion tracking instead of just a single "workout completed" checkbox.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Database Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20251022_add_exercise_tracking.sql`)
Added `completed_exercises` column to the `daily_logs` table:
- **Type**: JSONB (stores array of completed exercise names)
- **Default**: Empty array `[]`
- **Purpose**: Track which specific exercises have been completed

### 2. **TypeScript Types** (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
Updated `DailyLog` type to include:
```typescript
completed_exercises?: string[];
```

### 3. **Daily Tracker Component** (`src/components/DailyTracker.tsx`)

#### New Features:
âœ… **Individual Exercise Checkboxes**
   - Each exercise shows with a checkbox (Circle/CheckCircle icon)
   - Click any exercise to toggle its completion status
   - Completed exercises highlighted in green with border

âœ… **Visual Progress Bar**
   - Shows X / Y exercises completed
   - Animated progress bar (blue â†’ green when complete)
   - Celebration message when all exercises done

âœ… **Auto-Completion Logic**
   - `workout_completed` automatically set to `true` when ALL exercises checked
   - `workout_completed` automatically set to `false` if any exercise unchecked

âœ… **Persistent State**
   - Completed exercises saved to database immediately
   - State loads correctly on page refresh
   - Resets properly for new days

#### UI Improvements:
- Larger touch targets for mobile
- Hover effects on exercise items
- Clear visual feedback (green border + icon for completed)
- Shows sets, reps, and weight for each exercise
- Progress indicator at the bottom

## How to Use

### Setup:
1. **Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE daily_logs
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completed_exercises jsonb DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;
   ```

2. Test in your app at http://localhost:5173

### User Experience:
1. Navigate to "Dashboard" (Today's Tracker)
2. See today's workout with individual exercises
3. Click each exercise to mark it complete
4. Watch the progress bar fill up
5. See "ðŸŽ‰ Workout Complete!" when all exercises done

## Technical Details

### State Management:
- `completedExercises` state: `string[]` of exercise names
- Synced with database on every toggle
- Loaded from `daily_logs.completed_exercises` on component mount

### Database Logic:
- Each toggle updates both:
  - `completed_exercises`: Array of exercise names
  - `workout_completed`: Boolean (auto-calculated)

### Edge Cases Handled:
âœ… First exercise completion creates daily log  
âœ… Loading page shows correct state  
âœ… Switching days resets state  
âœ… No workout scheduled shows appropriate message  
âœ… Rest days show special UI  

## Benefits

### For Users:
- **Granular Tracking**: See exactly which exercises completed
- **Better Motivation**: Visual progress as you go
- **Flexibility**: Can pause workout and resume later
- **Clarity**: Always know what's left to do

### For Developers:
- **Data Rich**: Can analyze which exercises skipped most
- **Extensible**: Easy to add features like:
  - Exercise notes
  - Weight/rep tracking per exercise
  - Exercise history
  - Skip reasons

## Example Data Structure

```json
{
  "completed_exercises": [
    "Bench Press",
    "Squats",
    "Deadlift"
  ],
  "workout_completed": true
}
```

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- [ ] Add weight/reps input per exercise set
- [ ] Exercise timer or rest timer
- [ ] Exercise substitution suggestions
- [ ] Personal records tracking per exercise
- [ ] Exercise history viewer
- [ ] Skip/defer specific exercises
- [ ] Add extra exercises on the fly

**Status**: âœ… Complete and ready to use!
